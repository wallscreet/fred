# Economic Data Collector

This project compiles and stores various economic datasets (sourced primarily from the FRED API) into local JSON files for offline access. Data is appended incrementally to avoid duplication. Current datasets include monetary aggregates, housing indices, wages, and other key economic indicators.

Future work will involve exploratory data analysis (EDA) and potential predictive modeling.
